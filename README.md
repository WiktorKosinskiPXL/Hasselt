# Hasselt

Currently the rooftop textures and the street models appear to have gone missing in the .DAE file :(

## Gazebo

Need to have gazebo installed

```bash
$ gazebo hasselt.world

```

We have decided to refrain from using Gazebo.

## Unity

Current world was created using CityGen3D.
Unity collab will be used instead of GitHub because of the size of the project.
#### [DOWNLOAD](https://whaletank.be/login)
Importing the world without using Unity collab might cause issues.
